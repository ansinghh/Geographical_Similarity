# For calculating the similarity between points in two different arrays I considered euclidean
# however it is not the most accurate way of finding similar coordinates in a geographical setting
# Hence, upon some research, I came across the haversine distance formula which measures the 
# angular distance between two points on the surface of a sphere.
# Here is the source I used to help me implement the solution: https://nathan.fun/posts/2016-09-07/haversine-with-python/
